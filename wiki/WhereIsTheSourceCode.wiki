#summary Source is hosted at git hub

=Hosting Notes=
OMAP-U-Boot-Utils is hosted at two places:
  * *Source Code hosting*: Git Hub http://github.com/nmenon/omap-u-boot-utils/
  * *Binaries and Documentation*: code.google.com - this site.

=Access Source Code=
Considering that most U-Boot and Linux kernel developers are git users, the source is hosted at github. There are two access paths:
  * http protocol - for folks behind restrictive firewalls: http://github.com/nmenon/omap-u-boot-utils.git
  * git protocol: git://github.com/nmenon/omap-u-boot-utils.git
To get a copy of the code, it is as simple as:
{{{
git-clone git/http link
}}}
*NOTE*:
  * Users with proxy need to remember to setup their http_proxy variable. Here is more information: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1575
